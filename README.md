# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

OVERVIEW:
This project is a virtual pet adoption website that checks if a user has entered valid pet adoption details. It checks whether the pet adoption details entered follow a specific syntax.

Challenge:
It notifies the user of the invalid syntax or valid syntax after every addition of detail. It was a bit challenging in specifying the number of characters that should be used. 

Feedback:
It was overall fun and informative. 

Conclusion: This project was fun.
